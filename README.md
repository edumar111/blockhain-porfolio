# 🧠 Eduardo Blockchain Portfolio

Welcome to my **Blockchain Development Portfolio** — a collection of projects showcasing my experience building decentralized applications, smart contracts, and token ecosystems using **Solidity**, **Foundry**, **Hardhat**, and **OpenZeppelin**.  

---

## 🚀 About Me

I am a **Blockchain Engineer** focused on developing secure and scalable solutions for Web3.  
My work includes **ERC20 token design**, **smart contract upgradability**, **DeFi protocols**, and **on-chain infrastructure automation**.

I’m passionate about **decentralization**, **cryptographic security**, and creating **real-world blockchain applications**.

## 📦 Featured Projects
---

### 1. 💎 [erc20-own](https://github.com/edumar111/erc20-own)
**Custom ERC20 Token with Ownable2Step and Pausable Features**  
- Implements a **standard ERC20** following EIP-20 with customizations.  
- Includes **ownership management** using `Ownable2Step` and **emergency pause control** via `Pausable`.  
- Unit testing and code coverage implemented using **Foundry (forge)**.

🧩 *Key Topics:* EIP-20 Compliance, Pausable Token, Ownership Transfer, Solidity Best Practices.  

### 2. 🔄 [pok-usdt-swap](https://github.com/edumar111/pok-usdt-swap)
**POK ↔ USDT 1:1 Swap (6 decimals)**  
- Implements a **swap mechanism** between two ERC20 tokens (POK and USDT) at a 1:1 ratio.  
- Built with **OpenZeppelin** libraries, **ReentrancyGuard**, and **Ownable2Step**.  
- Features optional **fee in basis points**, pausable operations, and **Foundry test coverage**.  

🧩 *Key Topics:* ERC20, SafeERC20, Pausable, Foundry Tests, Gas Optimization.

### 3. 🧱 [erc20UUPS](https://github.com/edumar111/erc20UUPS)
**Upgradeable ERC20 (UUPS Proxy Pattern)**  
- Demonstrates **upgradeable smart contract architecture** using the **UUPS pattern**.  
- Integrates **Ownable2StepUpgradeable**, **PausableUpgradeable**, and **UUPSUpgradeable** from OpenZeppelin.  
- Focused on **security**, **maintainability**, and **on-chain evolution** without redeploying tokens.  

🧩 *Key Topics:* UUPS Proxy, Upgradeability, Initializable Contracts, Solidity Storage Gap.

## 🧪 Testing & Coverage

All projects include unit tests using **Foundry**:

```bash
forge build
forge test
forge coverage
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Solidity (v0.8.x)

* Foundry / Forge (for testing & coverage)

* OpenZeppelin Contracts

* UUPS Upgradeability Pattern

* EIP-20 Standard Compliance

* Hardhat (optional) for deployment scripts

* GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation for builds)



## 📈 Future Work

* Add ERC721 NFT projects (marketplaces, POK NFT Clubs).

* Deploy selected contracts on LACChain, Arbitrum, or Besu private networks.

* Integrate with React/Next.js DApps using ethers.js and Web3.js.
